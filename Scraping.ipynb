    "# Scrapping the need words from guttenberg.org\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed for web scraping, specifically targeting a webpage on the Project Gutenberg website. It begins by fetching the HTML content of the page using the requests library. Upon successfully retrieving the content, the script employs BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library to parse the HTML. It then searches for text within bold tags, looking specifically for instances where the bold text is preceded by a '#' followed by a number, using a regular expression to identify these patterns. For each match, it combines the matched pattern with the bold text into a string and stores these in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script also examines the HTML for table row (<tr>) elements, filtering them based on the presence of the terms \"CLASS\", \"SECTION\", or \"DIVISION\" within any <dt> elements they contain. Each filtered <tr> element is associated with the nearest preceding bold text that fits the earlier mentioned pattern. Special handling is applied to the first <tr> element in the \"SECTION\" and \"CLASS\" categories, where their texts are inserted at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the script writes the processed information to a text file named bold_words_with_numbers3.txt. For items in the list that are tuples (indicating a matched number and associated bold text), it writes both the number and the text to the file, with  consideration for texts that need further splitting. Other items,  are written directly to the file.\n"
